"Best of both worlds"

The phrase above perfectly describes what my game is all about.
Before I got in to computer science, I studied dental nursing hoping to become a dentist
but the universe put me in DT282 so I am now qualified as a Dental nurse and an ASPIRING PROGRAMMER.

When we got the task/assignment to make a game, I had this vision of combining both of my studies together.

This game is called : TARTAR WARS:PLAQUE MAN EDITION.

This game is HIGHLY inspired by starwars and pac-man.
Fun,simple yet exciting to play.

There is definitely room for improvement in this game,I wanted to implement
a leaderboard highscore interface, i wanted to add more characters and enhance the
game set up by adding levels etc.

I am very proud of this work I tried my best to put together everything I know(so far)
on processing. 

Please enjoy :)
